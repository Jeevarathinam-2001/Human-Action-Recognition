# Human-Action-Recognition
Aim of this project is to use deep learning architectures (in particular CNN and transfer learning models)
to classify different types of human actions like walking, running, sleeping, listening to music which can be 
useful in video surveillance as well as for foul detection in sports.
The dataset used in this project is an open source HAR dataset available in Kaggle.
